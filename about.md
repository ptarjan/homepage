## Background 

I was born in the beautiful, freezing cold, city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I grew up on a farm, about an hour's drive to the nearest city. I don't have any siblings but my parents put me in the same amount of activies as if they had 3 children. Therefore, I can swim, ski, dive, surf, skate, snowboard, bike, juggle, play piano, unicycle, do Tae Kwan Do, play hockey, run, and paint quite well.

I skipped Grade 3 (yes, that's how we say it in Canada) because I was in a Grade 2/3 split class, and was such a nerd, I learned both grades. Because of this, I graduated high school at age 16.

I got my first computer at the age of 12, a 486 with DOS 6.1. 2 weeks later I had successfully caused it not to boot, and fearing the wrath of my parents, I painstakingly reinstalled the OS. They never found out until they read this.

I was young and foolish, so I did my undergrad as a pure math + computer science double major. In my infinite wisdom I decided to do them in 4 years. I did manage to pull it off, but I don't recommend it to others wanting that. Take an extra year and enjoy it ;)

I did my masters in Computer Science at Stanford. This time, I took the recommended time length (5 quarters) and enjoyed the pace a bit more. I started a World of Warcraft addiction during my masters, yet another thing I don't recommend.

I graudated and went straight to Yahoo! for 2 years 9 months and 26 days. It was a wonderful place to work and a great first foray into the work world. My boss, Amit, kept joking that doing SearchMonkey as my first project was giving me unrealistic expectations since it was such a success.

And the rest is yest to be written.
